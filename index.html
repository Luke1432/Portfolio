        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Computer Science student at Ontario Tech University with a passion for software development and problem-solving. With experience in a variety of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python, I thrive in both front-end and back-end development. Through my work with frameworks like Quarkus and my contributions to open-source projects, I've honed my skills in building efficient, scalable applications. I have also developed interactive projects, such as a Battleship game using JavaScript, which showcases my ability to integrate logic with user-friendly interfaces. My background extends beyond programming â€” having worked at summer camps and with educational organizations, I bring strong communication, leadership, and teamwork skills to every project. Fluent in English, French, and German, I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with others to create impactful, user-focused solutions.</p>
