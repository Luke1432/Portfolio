        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am a passionate computer science student at Ontario Tech University, with a focus on software development and programming. Over the years, I have developed a strong skill set in Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and Linux, backed by hands-on experience through internships, summer camps, and personal projects. My time at Red Hat as an intern on the Quarkus team has honed my problem-solving and collaboration skills, allowing me to contribute to simplifying tools in the Quarkus ecosystem. In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen interest in community engagement, which is reflected in my work developing mobile applications for educational programs and my involvement in hackathons for youth. I am fluent in English, French, and German, and I maintain an active GitHub account where I share my projects and contributions. Feel free to explore my work and projects on GitHub!</p>
